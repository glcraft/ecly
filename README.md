# ecly - Gly's Console Editor

This project is very very young. there's nothing to see yet ðŸ˜….

Please hold on for some time.

# Motivation

The idea is to make a *simple* vscode like for console. There's plenty console app doing so, but I want to make something modulable, extensive, lsp compatible, and shortcut friendly instead of Vim friendly. It should be Vim compatible at some point but that's not my main purpose currently.

The program is developed in Rust.

See also [clui crate](https://github.com/glcraft/clui) for the text based user interface used in this app.

# License

For now, the project is **GPL3 licenced**. 

The idea is to encourage contributions during the early development. I may change later.
